                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In the quiet Himalayas, every handmade thing has its own story. These are not just crafts—they
                        are the memories made with care, faith, and old ways. These are the legacy of our old tradition,
                        left for us by our great ancestors. Behind every bit of thread, carving, and color, there's a
                        story whispered by the mountains and kept alive by the people who live there.</p>
                    <p>
                        These stories tell us that craftsmanship is more than just skill—it's feeling, history, and a
                        quiet way of talking that's been shared for years. In our blog today, we’ll look into five
                        beautiful Pahadi handicrafts and their stories.</p>

                    <h2 id="aipan">Aipan Art : Sacred Patterns of Kumaon</h2>
                    <p>Aipan is the traditional art form of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. It is derived from
                        “Arpan,” which means “likhai” or writing in English. It is mainly made during festivals,
                        rituals, or special occasions and is believed to bring good fortune and blessings to the family.
                    </p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="aipan1.jpeg" alt="Aipan Art">

                    <p>

                        Traditionally, it was made using ‘geru,’ which is red in color, and a paste of rice, also called
                        ‘biswar.’ The geru is applied on the surface, and with biswar, beautiful geometric shapes,
                        flowers, and designs symbolizing gods and goddesses are made. Nowadays, people use red and white
                        paint to make the Aipan; to make it more attractive, yellow and other colors are also used. The
                        art form originated in the Almora district and later on spread to other parts of the state. </p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="aipan2.jpeg" alt="Aipan Art">

                    <p>

                        The Aipan art form also received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in September 2021. It will
                        provide recognition and economic benefits to the traditional artisans and communities involved
                        in creating the art, and also preserving and promoting the rich cultural heritage for future
                        generations.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="ringal">Ringal Craft : Bamboo Weaving of the Himalayas</h2>
                    <p>Ringal craft is also one of the most beautiful crafts of the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand. It
                        is an old bamboo weaving tradition, which uses Ringal, a special type of bamboo that is slightly
                        thinner and more flexible, and grows in the upper altitudes of the state.</p>
                    <p>
                        The artisans harvest Ringal, dry it, split it into thin, fine strips, and weave them into a
                        strong, beautiful, useful, and long-lasting product. Through this, baskets, trays, storage
                        boxes, tokris, and many other products are made.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Ringal craft is a source of livelihood for many people living in the Himalayan villages; it not
                        only promotes our culture but also provides sustainable income while keeping the environment
                        unharmed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Next time if you visit the region, instead of plastic, choose sustainable products and buy
                            the Ringal crafts; it will not only promote sustainability but also support the artisans who
                            make these.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>

                    <h2 id="tamta">Tamta Copperware : The Metal Legacy of Almora</h2>
                    <p>The Tamta copperware craft is another old tradition of the Pahadi region carried by the Tamta
                        community in Almora. The word 'Tamta' itself refers to copper, which signifies craft embedded in
                        their identity. When the skilled coppersmiths (tamtas) from Rajasthan were brought by the Chand
                        dynasty of Kumaon to Almora, the craft further flourished here.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="tamta.jpeg"
                        alt="Tamta Copperware"><i>Source: Copperware of Almora losing sheen for Tamtas </i><br><br>
                    <p>


                        The crafting process involves heating copper sheets to make them soft and easy to give shape.
                        Hammering the copper for a desired shape. Then, the different parts are joined using a mix of
                        brass and zinc for a shiny finish, the final product is cleaned with an acid solution and then
                        rubbed with tamarind to give a warm glow. </p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="tamta (2).jpeg" alt="Tamta Copperware">
                    <p>

                        Tamta craftsmen produce a variety of copper items like water pots (gagar), religious bowls
                        (kundi), and musical instruments like the ransingha and dhol. The items are also highly valued
                        for their health benefits.
                        Due to high-tech machines, which make the copper products cheap, the families that are into this
                        profession struggle to compete in the market. Tamta copperware is a tradition of skill, daily
                        life, and rituals. Supporting this craft will help in preserving the legacy of our culture.
                    </p>


                    <h2 id="thulma">Thulma Blanket : Warmth Woven in the Mountains</h2>
                    <p>Uttarakhand’s arts and crafts are of various kinds, each having a unique style, story, and
                        identity. Out of these, one of the standout traditions is the Thulma blanket, woven in the
                        Himalayan villages.</p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="thumla.jpeg" alt="Thulma Blanket">
                    <i>Source : D'source Introduction | Punki and Thulma - Dharamghar</i><br><br>
                    <p>

                        These are high-quality blankets made using apparel-grade wool. They are soft and hairy in
                        texture with vibrant colors and attractive motifs. Thulmas are initially woven using white or
                        undyed wool and later dyed with different colors. The Thulma weaving tradition is not just a
                        craft—it represents a deep cultural heritage of Uttarakhand and remains a vital source of
                        livelihood for the weaving community.

                    <h2 id="jewellery">Pahadi Handcrafted Jewellery : Identity Worn with Pride</h2>

                    <p>

                        The Pahadi handicrafts are empty without their charming jewelry. These are the vibrant
                        expressions of the identity of the Pahadi people, their heritage, and their social ties. These
                        are important in social and religious events.

                        <li> <strong>Galobandh</strong> - It is a choker piece worn around the neck, made of gold squares and a red
                            thread base. Worn by married women of the Kumaon, Garhwal, Jaunsar, and Bhotiya communities.

                        <li> <strong>Pahunchi</strong>: These are gold bangles that are deeply symbolic for married women in both Kumaon
                            and Garhwal. They are made by embedding small gold beads on a red cloth and are mostly worn
                            on special family occasions and ritual gatherings.</li>

                        This jewelry tradition is deeply rooted in the social fabric of Uttarakhand. Pieces like the
                        Nathuli (nath) are especially symbolic in marriage—both as a gift and a mark of status. Married
                        women often wear Pahunchi and Gulobandh during sacred ceremonies and family events, reinforcing
                        their social and cultural identity.
                    </ul>
                    </p>


                    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The handicrafts of Uttarakhand are more than just handcrafted items; they are timeless
                        narratives. Every piece of jewelry worn by the women of Pahad with pride, every Aipan drawn at a
                        doorstep, every Ringal basket crafted with care, every Thulma woven on a simple loom, and every
                        copper pot hammered into shape all contain the essence and beauty of the mountains and the
                        feelings of the people who make them.</p>
                    <p>

                        These crafts are more than just customs; they are the source of livelihood for the people
                        residing in the Himalayan region. They also serve as the link between generations; they connect
                        the future, present, and past together. It is a symbol of their strength and a gentle reminder
                        that culture survives as long as loving hands keep creating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Preserving these Pahadi crafts is a means of honoring the people, stories, and legacy behind
                        them. Also, in today's modern era, where most of the work is done by machines to save time,
                        effort, and money, protecting the art and keeping it alive becomes more important. </p>
                    <p>
                        By supporting local craftspeople, we are preserving a legacy that has shaped Pahadi culture for
                        centuries rather than merely purchasing a product. To keep the mountains’ spirit alive for those
                        who come after us, let’s keep these crafts close to our hearts, celebrate their beauty, and keep
                        telling the stories they carry.
                    </p>
