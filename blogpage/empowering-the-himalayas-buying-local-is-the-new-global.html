                    <p>“Buy handmade, Be one in a million, not one of millions”. This quote highlights how important it
                        is to buy local items. Buying locally strengthens the labour force, increases the financial
                        condition of those areas, and boosts the fabric of humanity and brotherhood. The Himalayas are
                        the roof of the world. If we don't support and build the roof strongly, our house becomes
                        incomplete. The Himalayas is an amazing and unique place that has local herbs, local handicrafts
                        and local sustainable products. Let us see all the local products and why should we buy them.

                                microns). Pashima is now the flag bearer of the brand of shawls.

                                ordinary item. This exquisite item is the result of impeccable needlework on khadar or
                                muslin cloth, skillfully crafted by the queen and the royal ladies of Chamba during
                                their leisure moments. These 'rumaals,' adorned with meticulous detailing and exquisite
