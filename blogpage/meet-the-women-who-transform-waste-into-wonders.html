    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p> As we know, Uttarakhand is the state of the Gods, known as "Devbhoomi". However, as citizens of India, we sometimes fail to act responsibly. It's common to see people lacking awareness, littering, and polluting the area. Our organisation took an initiative to change waste into wonders, with the help of our volunteers and little toddlers, who are learning the sense of responsibility from a young age.</p>

<h2 id="gallery">Here are some pictures of our volunteers working together to create a positive change in the environment.</h2>



<p>Here’s one of our women volunteers sharing her insights about the Him Village e-Prahari Organisation:</p>

<h2 id="gargi-janeja">       Gargi Janeja (Volunteer) (Him village e-Prahari)</h2>
<img src="../gargi.jpeg" alt="Gargi Janeja" class="img-fluid" style="width:200px; height:200px; border-radius:10px; object-fit:cover;">
<p><strong>Why did she choose to work with this organisation?</strong><br>
“My decision to join Him Village e-Prahari was driven by a deep sense of responsibility toward environmental sustainability and community welfare. Over time, I observed how improper waste disposal practices were affecting both the health of rural communities and the natural surroundings they depend on. This sparked a personal commitment to contribute in a meaningful way. Him Village e-Prahari offered a platform where I could actively participate in creating awareness, promoting behavioural change, and encouraging sustainable waste management habits. I was particularly inspired by the organisation’s focus on empowering rural households through knowledge, skill-building, and community engagement. The opportunity to be part of an initiative that not only addresses an environmental challenge but also supports the upliftment of rural communities motivated me to volunteer. I wanted to help bridge the gap between awareness and action, and contribute to long-term, positive change in people’s lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Share one of your memorable incidents with this organisation </strong><br>
“One particularly memorable experience that made me feel proud occurred during a follow-up visit in a village where we had previously conducted a waste-segregation awareness session. A group of women approached me and explained how, after attending our workshop, they had collectively decided to adopt proper waste segregation at home. They shared that this simple practice had already helped reduce the amount of waste being burned in their neighbourhood, resulting in cleaner surroundings and fewer complaints of smoke-related discomfort.<br>
What stood out to me was not just the change in their daily routine but the confidence and ownership they displayed. They had even motivated a few neighbours to follow the same practices. Witnessing this shift reinforced my belief that community awareness programmes truly have the power to transform behaviour. It was a moment that made me realise the value of consistent engagement and the ripple effect that a single awareness session can create. Seeing the real, measurable impact of our efforts was both motivating and deeply fulfilling."</p>

<p>This is what the Him Village e-Prahari organisation stands for. We love working with nature and we care for it because sustainability is what we need.</p>

<p>We have our member from the HR team and the field work volunteer </p>

<h2 id="khushi-singh">    Khushi Singh (member of HR team and the field work-volunteer )</h2>
<img src="../khushi.jpeg" alt="Khushi Singh" class="img-fluid" style="width:200px; height:200px; border-radius:10px; object-fit:cover;">
<p>This is her insight:<br>
“I joined this foundation for the first time because I wanted to invest my time in something meaningful and impactful. Since I am new to this place, I was looking for a space where I could learn, grow, and contribute positively. When I became associated with this foundation, I immediately felt a welcoming and family-like environment that made me feel comfortable and valued.<br>
What inspired me the most was the dedication of the foundation toward protecting the environment and working for the better future of coming generations. Their passion, commitment, and sense of responsibility deeply influenced me. It made me realise that even small actions can create meaningful change when done with honesty and consistency.<br>
Through this foundation, I have not only learned about environmental issues but have also developed a strong personal understanding of my own role in society. Being a part of their activities has helped me connect with people who share the same purpose and values. It has also made me more aware of my own responsibilities toward nature and inspired me to continue contributing in whatever ways I can.<br>
Joining this foundation has truly been a meaningful step for me, giving me purpose, connection, and a stronger sense of responsibility toward protecting the world we live in.”</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do"> What work do they actually do?</h2>
<p>The waste gathered is diverse, and our team transforms it into wonders. We create decorative products from unwanted items like plastic bottles and glass bottles, giving them new life. For instance, we use glass bottles as lanterns, adding vibrant colours to the surroundings. We also repurpose waste paper for decorative purposes. This is the core aim of our organisation: to reduce waste and promote sustainability.</p>



<h2 id="village-movement">How a simple thought became a village movement?</h2>

<p>The mountains of Uttarakhand are known for their purity and calm nature, yet these landscapes also face the growing challenge of unwanted waste – plastic bottles, cloth pieces, old newspapers, and glass jars, often left forgotten near hills and food parts.</p>

<p>The women of our organisation couldn’t accept this as the future of their village and thought that they could actually change their surroundings. One fine morning, while they were working by the quiet brook and path, they realised that nature is being destroyed by many people in India, despite having civic sense.</p>

<p>They began collecting materials like plastic bottles, etc., to create innovative ideas – turning plastic bottles into decorative pieces, newspaper strips into wall hangings, and glass jars into beautiful showpieces.</p>

<p>All the women volunteers came together to change this and make something new, which they call ‘Waste into Wonders’. Their motive is to reduce waste and promote sustainability without needing fancy tools or modern machines.</p>

<p>They conduct workshops under trees or in schools, initiating students to create innovative items from waste. Their efforts aim to prevent waste from harming nature and attract people to sustainable practices.</p>

<p>Tourists admire their handmade, affordable, and culturally inspired work. The movement is slowly changing the mindset of village people, making them more careful about their waste. Children are collecting wrappers for craft projects, and people are working together towards a cleaner environment.</p>

<h2 id="community-culture">How do community culture and creativity shape their journey?</h2>

<p>As the initiative grew, women reached out to schools, youth groups, and the community, teaching children to make pen stands, planters, and wall hangings from daily waste. This helped the younger generation understand recycling’s importance. Students saved materials for craft work and encouraged family members to do the same. The link to Uttarakhand culture made their work special, using regional colours to make it brighter and traditional.</p>

<p>Volunteers support each other, celebrating festivals together, expressing unity and teamwork. The leading women dream of expanding the movement. This journey teaches that change can begin with a small idea or act of care. When people work together, simple waste can gain new meaning, proving creativity lives in every home and land.</p>

<p>Their story inspires, showing small actions combined to create larger results: cleaner surroundings, confident women, and a stronger community. Better habits can shape a better future.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>  This story showcases waste transformation and our core team’s thoughts, motivating us to create change. They empower women with new skills and independence, keeping the village clean. This initiative proves change begins small and grows through shared effort. The mountains of Uttarakhand carry their message: nothing is truly wasted when a community chooses to transform it beautifully. Follow @himvillageeprahari.</p>
